Got it 👍 You don’t want code — just a well-aligned URL + feature mapping for both Subscriber and Registration CRUD.
Here’s the clean, properly aligned format:

📌 Subscriber CRUD URLs

https://localhost:7085/Subscriber/List → Show all subscribers

https://localhost:7085/Subscriber/Create → Add new subscriber

https://localhost:7085/Subscriber/Edit/1 → Edit subscriber with ID = 1

https://localhost:7085/Subscriber/Details/1 → View details of subscriber with ID = 1

https://localhost:7085/Subscriber/Delete/1 → Delete subscriber with ID = 1

📌 Registration CRUD URLs

https://localhost:7085/Registration/List → Show all registrations

https://localhost:7085/Registration/Create → Add new registration

https://localhost:7085/Registration/Edit/1 → Edit registration with ID = 1

https://localhost:7085/Registration/Details/1 → View details of registration with ID = 1

https://localhost:7085/Registration/Delete/1 → Delete registration with ID = 1
